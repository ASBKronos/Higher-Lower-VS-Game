# Higher-Lower-VS-Game
A game in which we compare trending and current data
In this case, we start by randomly comparing say Neymar, a footballer from Brazil against Chloe Kardashian, a reality TV personality and businesswoman from the US
We need to find out who has more followers.
So if the user thinks it's 'B', they could be wrong or right.
If we are right, we go on to comparing the next person with the last person Neymar (if they have more followers)
So next we're comparing Rihanna a musician and businesswoman from Barbados against Shakira a musician from Columbia.
So if the user is going to guess Rihanna, they will get it right, and they get to score one point. This game continues on and on until you get to
the point where you get it wrong and your total score gets calculated
